# Data Structures and Algorithms

While talking about programming,the most important aspect comes in mind is logic building.
Coding is more about thinking then writting fancy paragraphs with different characters and symbols.
So to improve every programmers coding skills and to inhance their logical thinking to the next level,problem solving knowledge is mandatory as programming is more about thinking then typing.
This repository is created with the purpose of understanding different data structures and algorithms in a simpler way.

## What are we using ?

Basically c++/java are considered good for manipulating with datum and implementing algorithms due to their compilation and interprating mechanisms like converting the code into binary first.

But we are using `JavaScript` as it is also one of the powerful language out there which can do almost every thing as others provides.

## What will be the folder structure ?

For every specific topic,there will be a folder named with the topic,inside that there will be another folder consisting one js file and one readme file which will elaborate how we solved the perticular problem,its time and space complexity and also there will be links which will provide good documentation about the specific problem if there exists.

## How you will be benifited ?

The most important aspect of this repo is to provide structural and distinguishible learning path.There will be a documentation which will be explaining how the things are going behind the scenes.

Once you catch up with the main logic behind the solution of some specific problem,its just a matter of time for you to learn other languages like java and c++ because apart from syntax,the logic is going to be same if you want to enter into competitive coding.
