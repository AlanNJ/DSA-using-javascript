# Merging two sorted lists into one.

This is the approach which checks two sorted array and place them in a new array with newly sorted elements.

## Steps to achieve our goal state.

1. Create two variable which will hold the index of first and second array initially as 0 and an array variable assigned to empty array initially.
2. create a while loop checks for elements equal to the elements of smaller array.
3. Compare the current index value of both the list and push the smaller elements to an array by creating for loop.
4. Now,if first array has higher number of elements,then write a while loop and add that value to the newArray.
5. If second array has higher number of elements,then write a while loop and add that value to the newArray
