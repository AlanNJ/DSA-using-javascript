# Sorting the given array in increasing order using Bubble Sort

Bubble sort, also referred to as comparison sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly goes through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Before starting,I recommend you to go through this site and visualize how bubble sort works.(recommended)

## Steps to achieve our goal state.

1. First trigger the first element in an array by running a for loop upto its last element.
2. For the second element,create a for loop starting form one position up then the first element as j=i+1
3. While the loop runs first time,we will have our fist and second element.
4. Now compare if the first element is greater then the second,if so the case,simply swap the elements like in program.
5. When our both the loops completes,you will get the sorted array.
